## Coding Standards

### TypeScript Guidelines

- Use strict TypeScript settings
- Prefer `const` over `let`, avoid `var`
- Use explicit return types for public functions
- Avoid `any` types - use proper typing
- Use neverthrow Result types for error handling

### Code Style

- Use 2-space indentation
- No trailing whitespace
- Semicolons required
- Single quotes for strings
- Trailing commas in multiline structures

### Error Handling

- Use neverthrow Result types consistently
- Provide meaningful error messages
- Handle all error cases in tests
- Never throw exceptions - return Result types

### Testing Requirements

All contributions must include appropriate tests:

- **Unit tests** for new functions
- **Integration tests** for complex workflows  
- **Error case coverage** for all failure modes
- **Type safety tests** where applicable
- Maintain **>95% code coverage**

### Documentation

- Add JSDoc comments for public APIs
- Update README if adding new features
- Include usage examples for new functionality
- Update CHANGELOG for notable changes

## Library Scope

This library has a **focused scope**: extracting pseudorandom values from WebAuthn passkeys using the PRF extension.

**In scope:**
- PRF value extraction and formatting
- WebAuthn configuration helpers
- Robust error handling
- Type safety improvements
- Performance optimizations
- Security enhancements

**Out of scope:**
- General WebAuthn authentication flows
- Credential storage mechanisms
- Cryptographic implementations
- UI components
- Server-side integrations

## Security Considerations

When contributing:

- Never log or expose sensitive data
- Use secure coding practices
- Consider timing attack vectors
- Validate all inputs thoroughly
- Follow principle of least privilege
- Report security issues privately (see SECURITY.md)

## Release Process

1. Version bumps follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/)
2. All tests must pass in CI
3. Code coverage must remain >95%
4. Security audit must pass
5. Documentation must be updated
6. Release notes must be comprehensive

## Getting Help

- **GitHub Issues**: For bugs and feature requests
- **GitHub Discussions**: For questions and general discussion
- **Security Issues**: Email security@your-domain.com privately

## Recognition

Contributors will be:
- Listed in CONTRIBUTORS.md
- Mentioned in release notes for significant contributions
- Given credit in npm package metadata

## Development Tips

### Running Examples

```bash
# Build the library first
npm run build

# Start a local server
python -m http.server 8000

# Open browser to test examples
open http://localhost:8000/examples/browser-demo.html
```

### Testing WebAuthn

Since WebAuthn requires user interaction, our tests use mocked APIs. For manual testing:

1. Use HTTPS or localhost
2. Ensure you have a compatible authenticator
3. Test across different browsers
4. Verify PRF extension support

### Debugging

- Use browser DevTools for WebAuthn debugging
- Enable WebAuthn debugging in Chrome: `chrome://flags/#enable-webauthn-debugging`
- Check console for detailed error messages
- Use coverage reports to identify untested code paths

## Questions?

Don't hesitate to ask questions in GitHub Discussions or open an issue for clarification. We're here to help make your contribution successful!
